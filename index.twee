::What is Twine?
<a href="https://twinery.org">Twine</a> is a tool for making hypertext-based interactive fiction â€” text-based narrative games you play in a web browser by reading text and clicking on links! Twine has a user-friendly visual editor that makes it easy to make games even if you don't know how to program. This website was made in Twine!

::What is PlayFab?
<a href="https://playfab.com">PlayFab</a> is a hosted backend platform for game LiveOps. In plain English, that means it provides all of the server bits you need to run an online game: things like friend lists and voice chat, an in-game store and inventory management, and leaderboards. 

If you're making a Twine game, most of this isn't relevant to you! However, it does include a very good analytics service. Because it's meant for games, it's a better fit fo Twine games than many other non-game analytics tools. 

Its free tier is also very generous. If you're just using it to add analytics to your Twine game, it won't cost you anything.

::What is PlayFab-Twine?

PlayFab-Twine is a piece of software that makes it easy for you to add analytics to your Twine game without writing any custom code!

With only a few lines of copy/pasted code, and a tiny bit of configuration, it will automatically gather user behavior for you to look at later. It will:

* Track which nodes players visit, and in what order
* Track any number of Twine variables
* Give you the ability to easily show players choice graphs:

No identifying data is stored about your players, and their data will not be sold or used in any way.
